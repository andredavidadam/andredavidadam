# üí´ About Me:

My name is Andre, and I am a computer science student with a strong passion for technology and continuous learning. I started learning programming at a young age, but it is only now that I am pursuing a degree in computer science at the University of Aldo Moro in Bari, where I have gained solid theoretical and practical knowledge in the field of computer science.

Throughout my academic journey, I have had the opportunity to work on various projects, both individually and in groups, which have allowed me to refine my skills. Additionally, I had the chance to work as a collaborator at Rainweb Company, where I had the opportunity to work with a team of experienced developers and apply my knowledge in a professional web industry setting.

I am a highly motivated individual who is always seeking new opportunities to improve and expand my abilities. I enjoy working in teams and am always willing to share my knowledge with others. I thrive in the company of creative individuals who think outside the box.
